        <h2>Common Baseball Statistics:</h2>
        <p>Baseball statistics are numerical measures that help evaluate a player's performance and contribute to understanding the game's dynamics.<p></p>
        
        <p>
          Baseball statistics can be categorized into offensive, defensive, and pitching stats. Offensive stats include batting average, home runs, and RBIs, which measure a player's ability to hit and score runs. Defensive stats include fielding percentage and errors, which assess a player's defensive skills. Pitching stats include ERA (earned run average), strikeouts, and wins, which evaluate a pitcher's effectiveness on the mound.
          These stats are important for analyzing player performance, making strategic decisions, and comparing players across different eras of baseball.
        </p>

        Those stats are just the simpler ones. The more advanced stats include: WAR (Wins Above Replacement), OPS (On-base Plus Slugging), and WHIP (Walks plus Hits per Inning Pitched). These stats provide a more in depth view of a player's overall contribution to their team by considering various aspects of their performance.
        <p>
        Understanding baseball statistics enhances the appreciation of the game and allows fans and analysts to make informed evaluations of players and teams that can impact the teams performance in real time or over the course of the 162 game season.
