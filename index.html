        <h2>How the game of Baseball is played</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a game played between two teams of nine players each. The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team by hitting a ball and running around four bases in a counterclockwise direction.</p>
        <p>The game is divided into nine innings, with each team getting a turn at bat in each inning. Players on the field are divided into offense and defense, with the defensive team trying to get the offensive team out by striking them out, tagging them, or forcing them out. Once the defensive team gets three outs, then the teams switch roles and the other team gets a turn at bat.</p>
